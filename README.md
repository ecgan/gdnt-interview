My solution for GDNT interview.

\* Note: GDNT is a random string that I used to represent the company.

## How to run

Prerequisites: Make sure you have [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed. This is used to manage Node.js versions.

1. Run `nvm use` to switch to the correct Node.js version.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run test` to run the tests. You should see all tests passing.
4. Run `npm run test:coverage` to run the tests with coverage. You should see all tests passing and the coverage report in the terminal.
