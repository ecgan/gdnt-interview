# gdnt-interview

My solution for GDNT interview.

Note: GDNT is a random string that I used to represent the company. The interview process happened in May 2025. All the code in this repository are done without any use of AI as requested by the company. This repository is meant for learning and documentation purposes.

## How to run

Prerequisites: Make sure you have [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed. This is used to manage Node.js versions.

1. Run `nvm use` to switch to the correct Node.js version.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run test` to run the tests. You should see all tests passing.
4. Run `npm run test:coverage` to run the tests with coverage. You should see all tests passing and the coverage report in the terminal.
